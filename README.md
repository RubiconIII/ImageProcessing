# Image Processing Plugins for ImageJ

By: Curtis P. Hohl 👨‍💻

These programs were written to explore various image processing techniques using ImageJ. The topics covered include blob analysis, contrast enhancement, inverting and translating specific pixels, identifying colored objects, and using seperable filters.

I developed this based on my studies in an Image Processing directed study.
